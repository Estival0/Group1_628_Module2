# Group1_628_Module2
 The files for module2

This github gives all of things about we do for module2. In the Rmd, it contains all R codes about data cleaning, fitting models, visualizing, and diagnosis. And the result is in the HTML. What is more, in the file--module2_files/figure-html, it also give all plots we used in Rmd. If you have any problems with plots, talbe, and etc, you can see the details in Rmd or HTML. For Rmd, you can just download the code and raw data to knit it in the Rstudio.

There are two data sets. BodyFat is the raw data, and BodyFat_cleaned is the cleaning data. The steps and explanation of data cleaning are all in beginning of the Rmd and HTML.

What is more, we also upload our shiny APP code in the file of Group1App. If you have any questions about how we implement this APP and how this calculator APP runs, you could see the details of its R code. And you could just open Rstudio and click run-app, you will get the app page. What you need to remember is that if you download to run your local, do not forget to download the plot in the file.

And we give the two pages summary to summarize what we do and what we find in 628_module2_Summary_Group1.pdf. It describes how we choose model, what we can do with our model, and the strength and weakness of our model.
