# Group1_628_Module2
 The code and data for module2

This github gives all of things about we do for module2. In the Rmd, it contains all R codes about data cleaning, fitting models, visualizing, and diagnosis. And the result is in the HTML. What is more, in the file--module2_files/figure-html, it also give all plots we used in Rmd.
There are two data sets. BodyFat is the raw data, and BodyFat_cleaned is the cleaning data. The steps and explanation of data cleaning are all in the Rmd.
